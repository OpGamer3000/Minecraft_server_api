# Minecraft_server_api [alpha]
This is a API for my minecraft server!

So if you want to do something with this API then here are some tips:

The main site for the API is: "https://Minecraftserverapi.opgamer3000pro.repl.co"



### List of requests and outputs:

## /stat:
Returns the current status of server in "true" or "false".

## /setStat?stat=true/false&pass=password123:
Sets the current stat.

## /getDowntime
